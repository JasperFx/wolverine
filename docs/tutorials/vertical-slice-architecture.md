# Vertical Slice Architecture

::: info
This guide is written from the standpoint of a [CQRS Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs).
While we think a vertical slice architecture (VSA) could be valuable otherwise, vertical slices and
CQRS are a very natural pairing.

Wolverine is well suited for a "Vertical Slice Architecture" approach where, to over simplify things a bit, you
generally try to organize code by feature or use case rather than by horizontal technical layering. Most of the content
about "Vertical Slice Architecture" practices in the .NET ecosystem involve the MediatR framework. It's important
to note that while you can use [Wolverine as "just" a mediator tool](/tutorials/mediator) and a drop in replacement for MediatR,
we feel that you'll achieve better results, more testable code, and far simpler code over all by instead leaning into Wolverine capabilities.

## Wolverine's Philosophy toward Vertical Slice Architecture

Alright, before we potentially make you angry by trashing the current Clean/Onion Architecture approach that's rampant
in the .NET ecosystem, let's talk about what the Wolverine community thinks is important for achieving good results
in a long lived, complex software system.

**Effective test coverage is paramount for sustainable development.** More than layering schemes or the right abstractions
or code structure, we believe that effective automated test coverage does much more to enable sustainable development of a
system over time. And by "effective" test coverage, we mean an automated test suite that's subjectively fast, reliable, and has
enough coverage that you feel like it's not risky to change the system code. Designing for testability is a huge
topic in its own right, but let's just say for now that step one is having your business or workflow logic largely
decoupled from infrastructure concerns. It's also very helpful to purposely choose technologies that are better behaved
in integration testing and have a solid local Docker story.

**The code is easy to reason about.** It's relatively easy to identify the system inputs and follow the processing to understand the relationship
between system inputs and the effects of those inputs including changes to the database, calls to other systems, or messages
raised by those inputs. We've seen too many enterprise systems that suffer from bugs partially because it's just too hard to
understand where to make logical changes or to understand what unintended consequences might pop up. We've also seen applications
with very poor performance due to how the application interacted with its underlying database(s), and inevitably that problem
is partially caused by excessive layering making it hard to understand how the system is really using the database.

**Ease of iteration.** Some technologies and development techniques allow for much easier iteration and adaptation than other
tools that might be much more effective as a "write once" approach. For example, using a document database approach leads
to easier evolutionary changes of persisted types than an ORM would. And an ORM would lead to easier evolution than writing
SQL by hand.

*Modularity between features.* Technologies change over time, and there's always going to be a reason to want to upgrade
your current dependencies or even replace dependencies. Our experience in large enterprise systems is that the only things
that really make it easier to upgrade technologies are effective test coverage to reduce risk and the ability to upgrade
part of the system at a time instead of having to upgrade an entire technical layer of an entire system. This might very well
push you toward a micro-service or [modular monolith approach](/tutorials/modular-monolith), but we think that the vertical slice architecture approach is
helpful in all cases as well.

So now let's talk about how the recommended Wolverine approach will very much differ from a layered Clean/Onion Architecture
approach or really any modern [Ports and Adapters](https://8thlight.com/insights/a-color-coded-guide-to-ports-and-adapters) approach that emphasizes abstractions and layers for loose coupling.

We're big, big fans of the [A Frame Architecture](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables/testing-without-mocks#a-frame-arch) idea for code organization to promote testability without just throwing
in oodles of abstractions and mock objects everywhere (like what happens in many Clean Architecture codebases). Wolverine's
["compound handler" feature](/guide/handlers/#compound-handlers), its [transactional middleware](/guide/durability/marten/transactional-middleware), and its [cascading message feature](/guide/handlers/cascading) are all examples of built in
support for "A-Frame" structures.

![A Frame Architecture](/a-frame.png)

With the "A-Frame Architecture" approach, you're trying to isolate behavioral logic from infrastructure by more or
less dividing the world up into three kinds of responsibilities in code:

1. Actual business logic that makes decisions and decides how to change the state of the application or what next steps to take
2. Infrastructure services. For example, persistence tools like EF Core's `DbContext` or service gateways to outside web services
3. Coordination or controller logic sitting on top that's delegating to both the infrastructure and business logic code, but keeping those two areas of the code separate

For more background on the thinking behind the "A Frame Architecture" (which like "Vertical Slice Architecture", is more about code organization than architecture),
we'll recommend:

* Jeremy's post from 2023 about the [A-Frame Architecture with Wolverine](https://jeremydmiller.com/2023/07/19/a-frame-architecture-with-wolverine/)
* [Object Role Stereotypes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2008/august/patterns-in-practice-object-role-stereotypes) by Jeremy from
  the old MSDN Magazine. That article focuses on Object Oriented Programming, but the basic concept applies equally to the
  functional decomposition that Wolverine + the "A-Frame" leans toward.
* [A Brief Tour of Responsibility-Driven Design](https://www.wirfs-brock.com/PDFs/A_Brief-Tour-of-RDD.pdf)
  by Rebecca Wirfs-Brock -- and again, it's focused on OOP, but we think the concepts apply equally to just using functions or methods too

For the most part, Wolverine should enable you to make most handler or HTTP methods be pure functions.

We're more or less going to recommend against wrapping your persistence tooling like Marten or EF Core with any kind of
repository abstractions and mostly just utilize their APIs directly in your handlers or HTTP endpoint methods. We believe the
"A-Frame Architecture" approach mitigates any *important* coupling between business or workflow logic and infrastructure.

The ["specification" pattern](https://jeremydmiller.com/2024/12/03/specification-usage-with-marten-for-repository-free-development/) or really even just reusable helper methods from outside of a vertical slice can be used
to avoid duplication of complex query logic, but for the most part, we find it helpful to see queries that are directly
related to a vertical slice in the same code file. Which if you're reading this guide, you hopefully see how to do so
without actually making business logic coupled to infrastructure even if data access and business logic appears in the
same code file or even the same handler type.

Do utilize Wolverine's
[side effect](/guide/handlers/side-effects) model and cascading message support to be able to get to pure functions in your handlers.

## Enough navel gazing, show me code already!

Let's just jump into a couple simple examples. First, let's say you're building a message handler that processes a `ProcessOrder`
command. With this example, I'm going to use [Marten](/guide/durability/marten) for object persistence, but it's just not that different with Wolverine's 
[EF Core](/guide/durability/efcore) or [RavenDb](/guide/durability/ravendb) integration. 

I'll do that in a single C# file named `PlaceOrder.cs`:

```csharp
public record PlaceOrder(string OrderId, string CustomerId, decimal Amount);

public class Order
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string CustomerId { get; set; }
    public decimal Amount { get; set; }

    public class Validator : AbstractValidator<PlaceOrder>
    {
        public Validator()
        {
            RuleFor(x => x.OrderId).ShouldNotBeNull();
            RuleFor(x => x.CustomerId).ShouldNotBeNull();
            RuleFor(x => x.Amount).ShouldNotBeNull();
        }
    }
}

public static class PlaceOrderHandler
{
    // Transaction Script style
    // I'm assuming the usage of transactional middleware
    // to actually call IDocumentSession.SaveChangesAsync()
    public static void Handle(
        PlaceOrder command, 
        IDocumentSession session)
    {
        var order = new Order
        {
            Id = command.OrderId, 
            CustomerId = command.CustomerId, 
            Amount = command.Amount
        };
        
        session.Store(order);
    }
}
```

For the first pass, I'm using a very simple [transaction script](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/transactionScript.html) approach that
just mixes in the Marten `IDocumentSession` (basically the equivalent to an EF Core `DbContext`) right in the behavioral code. For very
simplistic cases, this is probably just fine, especially if the interfaces for the infrastructure are easily "mockable" to substitute
out in isolated, solitary unit tests. Or if you happen to be using infrastructure like [Marten](https://martendb.io) that has is relatively
friendly to "sociable" integration testing. 

::: tip
See [Martin Fowler's Unit Test](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html) write up for a discussion of "solitary vs sociable" tests.
:::

A couple other things to note about the code sample above:

* You'll notice that the method is synchronous and doesn't call into `IDocument.SaveChangesAsync()` to commit the implied unit of work.
  I'm assuming that's happening by utilizing Wolverine's [transactional middleware](/guide/durability/marten/transactional-middleware) approach that happily works for Marten, EF Core, and RavenDb at the time of this writing.
* There's a Fluent Validation validator up there, but I didn't directly use it, because I'm assuming the usage of the [Fluent Validation middleware package](/guide/handlers/fluent-validation)
  that comes in a Wolverine extension Nuget.
* I didn't utilize any kind of repository abstraction around the raw Marten `IDocumentSession`. Much more on this below, but my value
  judgement is that the simpler code is more important than worrying about swapping out the persistence tooling later.

A "transaction script" style isn't going to be applicable in every case, so let's look to decouple that handler completely
from Marten and make it a ["pure function"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) that's a little easier to get into a unit test by leveraging some of Wolverine's 
"special sauce":

```csharp
public static class PlaceOrderHandler
{
    public static Insert<Order> Handle(PlaceOrder command)
    {
        var order = new Order
        {
            Id = command.OrderId, 
            CustomerId = command.CustomerId, 
            Amount = command.Amount
        };

        return Storage.Insert(order);
    }
}
```

The `Insert<T>` is one of Wolverine's [Storage Side Effect types](/guide/handlers/side-effects.html#storage-side-effects) that can help you specify persistence actions as side
effects from message or HTTP endpoint handlers without actually having to couple the handler or HTTP endpoint methods to
persistence tooling or even their abstractions. With this being a "pure function", we can walk right up to it and test its
functionality with a simple little unit test like so (using [xUnit.Net](https://xunit.net/)):

```csharp
    [Fact]
    public void handling_place_order_creates_new_order()
    {
        // Look Ma, no mocks anywhere in sight!
        var command = new PlaceOrder("111", "222", 100.23M);
        var action = PlaceOrderHandler.Handle(command);
        
        action.Entity.Id.ShouldBe(command.OrderId);
        action.Entity.CustomerId.ShouldBe(command.CustomerId);
        action.Entity.Amount.ShouldBe(command.Amount);
    }
```

If you'll notice, we didn't use any further database abstractions, we didn't create umpteen separate Clean/Onion Architecture
projects for each and every technical layer, and we also didn't use any mock objects whatsoever to test the code. We just walked right up
and called a method with its input and measured its expected outputs. Testability *and* simplicity FTW!

Now, let's try a little more complex sample to cancel an order, and get into HTTP endpoints while we're at it. 
This time around, let's say that the `CancelOrder` command should do nothing if the order doesn't exist, or if it
has already been shipped. Otherwise, we should delete the order and publish a `OrderCancelled` domain event to be handled by other modules
in the system or to notify other, external systems. Again, starting with a transaction script approach *first*, we could
have this code:

```csharp
public record CancelOrder(string OrderId);

public record OrderCancelled(string OrderId);

public static class CancelOrderHandler
{
    public static async Task Handle(
        CancelOrder command, 
        IDocumentSession session, 
        IMessageBus messageBus,
        CancellationToken token)
    {
        var order = await session.LoadAsync<Order>(command.OrderId, token);
        
        // You should probably log something at the least here
        if (order == null) return;
        
        if (order.HasShipped) return;
        
        // Maybe it's a soft delete here?
        session.Delete(order);
        
        // Publish a domain event to let other things in the system know to
        // take actions to stop shipping, inventory, who knows what
        await messageBus.PublishAsync(new OrderCancelled(command.OrderId));
    }
}
```

Now, to hook this up to HTTP, we *could* delegate to Wolverine as a mediator tool as
is common in the .NET ecosystem today, either directly in the `Program` file:

```csharp
app.MapPost("/api/orders/cancel", (CancelOrder command, IMessageBus bus, CancellationToken token) => bus.InvokeAsync(command, token));
```

But since the `Program` file would get absolutely overrun with a lot of unrelated forwarding calls to Wolverine's `IMessageBus`
entry point, and the ugliness would be much worse when you remember how much extra code you would add for [OpenAPI metadata](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/openapi/overview?view=aspnetcore-9.0).
There's no kind of automatic discovery for Minimal API like there is for MVC Core (or MediatR or Wolverine itself of course),
so you might have to resort to extra mechanisms in the same file just to register the Minimal API endpoints or give up 
and toss in an MVC Core controller just to delegate to Wolverine as a "Mediator". 

But wait, there's more! You probably want to give your HTTP API's clients some decent response to explain when and why a 
request to cancel an order was rejected. The Minimal API `IResult` gives you an easy way to do that, so we *could* 
have our Wolverine return an `IResult` result something like this:

```csharp
public static class CancelOrderHandler
{
    public static async Task<IResult> Handle(
        CancelOrder command, 
        IDocumentSession session, 
        IMessageBus messageBus,
        CancellationToken token)
    {
        var order = await session.LoadAsync<Order>(command.OrderId, token);
        
        // return a 404 if the order doesn't exist
        if (order == null) return Results.NotFound();

        // return a 400 with a description of why the order could not be cancelled
        if (order.HasShipped) return Results.BadRequest("Order has already been shipped");
        
        // Maybe it's a soft delete here?
        session.Delete(order);
        
        // Publish a domain event to let other things in the system know to
        // take actions to stop shipping, inventory, who knows what
        await messageBus.PublishAsync(new OrderCancelled(command.OrderId));

        return Results.Ok();
    }
}
```

and change the Minimal API call to:

```csharp
app.MapPost("/api/orders/cancel", (CancelOrder command, IMessageBus bus, CancellationToken token) => bus.InvokeAsync<IResult>(command, token));
```

Now, the `IResult` return type by itself is a bit of a "mystery meat" response that could mean anything, so Minimal API
can't glean any useful OpenAPI metadata from that, so you'd have to chain some extra code behind the call to `MapPost()`
just to add OpenAPI declarations. That's tedious noise code. 

Let's instead introduce [Wolverine.HTTP endpoints instead]() and rewrite the cancel order process -- this time with a route
value instead of the request body -- to simplify the code:

```csharp
public static class CancelOrderEndpoint
{
    public static ProblemDetails Validate(Order order)
    {
        return order.HasShipped
            ? new ProblemDetails { Status = 400, Detail = "Order has already shipped" }
            
            // It's all good, just keep going!
            : WolverineContinue.NoProblems;
    }

    [WolverinePost("/api/orders/cancel/id"), EmptyResponse]
    public static (Delete<Order>, OrderCancelled) Post([Entity] Order order)
    {
        return (Storage.Delete(order), new OrderCancelled(order.Id));
    }
}
```

And there's admittedly a bit to unpack here:

* The `[EmptyResponse]` attribute is a Wolverine thing that tells Wolverine.HTTP that the endpoint produces no response,
  so Wolverine emits a 204 status code for empty response, and "knows" that none of the return values should be used as
  the HTTP response body
* The `Validate()` method is an example of *[Compound Handlers](/guide/handlers/#compound-handlers)* (this applies equally to Wolverine HTTP endpoints) in Wolverine, and 
  will be called before the main method. By returning a [`ProblemDetails`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.problemdetails?view=aspnetcore-9.0)
  type from that method, that tells Wolverine that the method might stop all other processing by returning, well, problems. Learn more about
  how [Wolverine.HTTP uses the ProblemDetails](/guide/http/problemdetails) response type. Arguably, this is a built in form of [Railway Programming](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) in
  Wolverine (or at least a similar concept), but without the ugly high code ceremony that comes with Railway Programming. An idiom with Wolverine development is 
  to largely utilize `Validate` methods to make the main handler or endpoint method be for the ["Happy Path"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path).
* It's legal to return .NET tuple values from either message handler or HTTP endpoint methods, with Wolverine treating each "return value" independently
* The `Delete<Order>` return type is a known [persistence "side effect"]() by Wolverine, so it "knows" to use that to delegate to the
  configured persistence tooling for the `Order` entity, which in this sample application is Marten. *For EF Core, Wolverine is smart enough to 
  use the correct `DbContext` for the entity type if you are using multiple `DbContext` types.*
* In this case, because of the `[EmptyResponse]` declaration, any return value that doesn't have any other special handling is 
  considered to be a [cascading message](/guide/handlers/cascading) and Wolverine pretty well treats it the same as if you'd called `IMessageBus.PublishAsync()`. We highly recommend
  using the cascading message signature instead of directly invoking `IMessageBus.PublishAsync()` as a way to simplify your code,
  keep your handler/endpoint methods "pure functions" whenever possible, and also to make the code more declarative about the side
  effects that happen as a result of system inputs
* The `[Entity]` attribute is a [persistence helper](/guide/handlers/persistence.html#automatically-loading-entities-to-method-parameters) in Wolverine. Wolverine
  is actually generating code using your persistence tooling (Marten in this case, but EF Core and RavenDb are also supported) to load
  the order using the "id" route argument from Marten's `IDocumentSession` service and passing it into both the main method and
  the `Validate()` method. By default, the `[Entity]` value is considered to be "Required", so if the entity is not found, it will
  stop all other processing and return a 404 status code. No other code is necessary.

Whew, but wait, there's more! Let's say that you've opted to use Wolverine's transactional outbox integration, and for now,
let's assume that you're just using local queues with this configuration in your `Program` file:

```csharp
builder.Host.UseWolverine(opts =>
{
    // Other Wolverine configuration...
    
    opts.Policies.AutoApplyTransactions();
    opts.Policies.UseDurableLocalQueues();
});
```

and for Marten:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddMarten(opts =>
{
    // Marten configuration...
})
    // This adds Marten integration 
    // and PostgreSQL backed message persistence
    // to Wolverine in this application
    .IntegrateWithWolverine();
```

::: info
Wolverine makes no distinction between "events" and "commands". It's all a message to Wolverine. "Event vs command" is 
strictly a logical role in Wolverine usage.
:::

In this case, the outgoing `OrderCancelled` event message will happen **durably** through Wolverine's transactional inbox (just to be technical, the local queues when durable go through the inbox storage).
This is a really important detail because it means that the event processing won't be lost if the process happens to crash
in between processing the initial HTTP POST and the event message being processed through the queue because Wolverine can
recover that work in a process restart or "fail" the message over to being processed by another active application node. 
Moreover, Wolverine local queues can use [Wolverine's error handling policies](/guide/handlers/error-handling) for retry loops, scheduled retries, or even circuit
breakers if there are too many failures. The point here is that Wolverine is very suitable for creating resilient systems
*even* with that low code ceremony model. 

One last point, not only is the Wolverine.HTTP approach simpler than the commonly used Minimal API delegating to a Mediator approach,
there's a couple other benefits that are worth calling out:

* Wolverine.HTTP has its own built in discovery for endpoints and routes, so you don't need to rig up your own discovery mechanisms
  like folks do in common "Vertical Slice Architecture with Minimal API and MediatR" approaches
* Wolverine.HTTP tries really hard to glean OpenAPI metadata off of the type signatures of endpoint methods and the applied
  middleware like the `Validate` method up above. This will lead to spending less time decorating your code with OpenAPI metadata
  attributes or Minimal API fluent interface calls


## Recommended Layout

::: tip
You might want to keep message contract types that are shared across modules or applications in separate libraries
for sharing. In that case we've used the message handler or endpoint class name as the file name.
:::

You'll of course have your own preferences, but [JasperFx Software](https://jasperfx.net) clients have had success by
generally naming a file after the command or query message, even for HTTP endpoints. So a `PlaceOrder.cs` file might
contain:

* The `PlaceOrder` command or HTTP request body type itself
* If using one of the [Fluent Validation](/guide/handlers/fluent-validation) integrations, maybe a `Validator` class that's just
  an inner type of `PlaceOrder`, but the point is to just keep it in the same file
* The actual `PlaceOrderHandler` or `PlaceOrderEndpoint` for HTTP endpoints

And honestly, that's it for many cases. I would of course place closely related command/event/http messages or handlers 
in the same namespace. That's the easy part, so let's move on to what might be controversial. Let's step into a quick, simplistic example
that's using [Marten](https://martendb.io) for persistence:


Or for an HTTP endpoint, just swap out `PlaceOrderHandler` for this:

```csharp
public static class PlaceOrderEndpoint
{
    [WolverinePost("/api/orders/place")]
    public static void Post(
        PlaceOrder command, 
        IDocumentSession session)
    {
        var order = new Order
        {
            Id = command.OrderId, 
            CustomerId = command.CustomerId, 
            Amount = command.Amount
        };
        
        session.Store(order);
    }
}
```

We feel like it's much more important and common to need to reason about a single system input at one time than it ever is to 
need to reason about the entire data access layer or even the entire domain logic layer at one time. To that end the Wolverine
team recommends putting any data access code that is **only germane to one vertical slice** directly into the vertical slice
code as a default approach. To be blunt, we are recommending that you largely forgo wrapping any kind of repository abstractions
around your persistence tooling, but instead, purposely seek to shrink down the call stack depth (how deep do you go in a handler calling
service A that calls service B that might call repository C that uses persistence tool D to...).

## What about the query side?

We admittedly don't have nearly as much to say about using Wolverine on the query side, but here are our rough recommendations:

1. If you are able and willing to use Wolverine.HTTP, do not use Wolverine as a "mediator" underneath `GET` query handlers. We realize
   that is a very common approach for teams that use ASP.Net MVC Core or Minimal API with MediatR, but we believe that is just
   unnecessary complexity and that will cause you to write more code to satisfy OpenAPI needs
2. We would probably just use the application's raw persistence tooling directly in `GET` endpoint methods and depend on 
   integration testing for the query handlers -- maybe through [Alba specifications](https://jasperfx.github.io/alba).
