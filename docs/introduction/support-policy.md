# Support Policy

Community support (via our Github & Discord) is offered for the current major version of Wolverine. The previous major version is supported for high-priority bug and security patches for up to 6 months after a new major version is released. 

Customers with a [JasperFx Support Plan](https://jasperfx.net/support-plans/) are granted priority for questions, feature requests and bug fixes. Support for previous versions of Wolverine is also available under these plans.
