# Getting Started with Wolverine as Message Bus

::: tip
While today it is perfectly possible to use multiple transport types in a single Wolverine application, each
separate transport can only connect to a single message broker. This may change in the future depending
on user demand.
:::

There's certainly some value in Wolverine just being a command bus running inside of a single process, but now
it's time to utilize Wolverine to both publish and process messages received through external infrastructure like [Rabbit MQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
or [Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/).

## Terminology

To put this into perspective, here's how a Wolverine application could be connected to the outside world:

The diagram above should just say "Message Handler" as Wolverine makes no structural differentiation between commands or events, but Jeremy is being too lazy to fix the diagram.

## Configuring Messaging

There's a couple moving parts to using Wolverine as a messaging bus. You'll need to configure connectivity to external infrastructure like
Rabbit MQ brokers, set up listening endpoints, and create routing rules to teach Wolverine where and how to send your messages.

The [TCP transport](/guide/messaging/transports/tcp) is built in, and the ["local" in memory queues](/guide/messaging/transports/local) can be used like a transport, but you'll need to configure connectivity for
every other type of messaging transport adapter to external infrastructure. In all cases so far, the connectivity to external transports is done through
an extension method on `WolverineOptions` using the `Use[ToolName]()` idiom that is now common across .NET tools.

For an example, here's connecting to a Rabbit MQ broker:

<!-- snippet: sample_configuring_connection_to_rabbit_mq -->
<a id='snippet-sample_configuring_connection_to_rabbit_mq'></a>
```cs
using Oakton;
using Wolverine;
using Wolverine.RabbitMQ;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Host.UseWolverine(opts =>
{
    // Using the Rabbit MQ URI specification: https://www.rabbitmq.com/uri-spec.html
    opts.UseRabbitMq(new Uri(builder.Configuration["rabbitmq"]));

    // Or connect locally as you might for development purposes
    opts.UseRabbitMq();

    // Or do it more programmatically:
    opts.UseRabbitMq(rabbit =>
    {
        rabbit.HostName = builder.Configuration["rabbitmq_host"];
        rabbit.VirtualHost = builder.Configuration["rabbitmq_virtual_host"];
        rabbit.UserName = builder.Configuration["rabbitmq_username"];

        // and you get the point, you get full control over the Rabbit MQ
        // connection here for the times you need that
    });
});
```
