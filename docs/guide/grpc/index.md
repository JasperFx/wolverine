# gRPC Services with Wolverine

::: info
The `WolverineFx.Grpc` package lets you expose Wolverine handlers as ASP.NET Core gRPC services
with minimal wiring. It supports both the **code-first**
([protobuf-net.Grpc](https://protobuf-net.github.io/protobuf-net.Grpc/)) and **proto-first**
([Grpc.Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/)) styles.

## Why gRPC?

If you're already using Wolverine to orchestrate message handlers, sagas, and HTTP endpoints,
gRPC gives you another edge protocol for the same handlers. Benefits:

- **Strongly-typed contracts** shared across .NET and non-.NET services via `.proto` files, or code-first
  contracts that never leave C#.
- **Streaming** first-class — plays naturally with Wolverine's [`IMessageBus.StreamAsync<T>`](/guide/messaging/message-bus.html#streaming-responses).
- **Wolverine handler reuse** — the same handler can back a REST endpoint, an async message, and a
  gRPC call without duplication.
- **Canonical error semantics** — ordinary .NET exceptions thrown by a handler are mapped to the
  right gRPC `StatusCode` automatically, following [Google AIP-193](https://google.aip.dev/193).

## What's in this section

Start here to get Wolverine's gRPC adapter running, then drill into the page that matches what you're
building:

- [How gRPC Handlers Work](./handlers) — the service → `IMessageBus` → handler flow, how it differs
  from HTTP and messaging handlers, and how OpenTelemetry traces survive the hop.
- [Code-First and Proto-First Contracts](./contracts) — the two contract styles side by side so you
  can pick (or mix) them.
- [Error Handling](./errors) — the default AIP-193 exception → `StatusCode` table plus the opt-in
  `google.rpc.Status` pipeline for rich, structured details.
- [Streaming](./streaming) — server streaming today, bidirectional via a manual bridge, and the
  shape of the cancellation contract.
- [Typed gRPC Clients](./client) — `AddWolverineGrpcClient<T>()`, the Wolverine-flavored wrapper over
  `Grpc.Net.ClientFactory` that adds envelope-header propagation and `RpcException` → typed-exception
  translation on the consuming side.
- [Samples](./samples) — runnable end-to-end samples with pointers to the equivalent official
  [grpc-dotnet examples](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-dotnet/tree/master/examples) for comparison.

## Getting Started

Add the integration package and register it alongside the usual Wolverine bootstrap. `AddWolverineGrpc`
does **not** register a gRPC host — callers decide whether they want code-first or proto-first (or both):

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Host.UseWolverine(opts =>
{
    opts.ApplicationAssembly = typeof(Program).Assembly;
});

// Pick one (or both):
builder.Services.AddCodeFirstGrpc();   // protobuf-net.Grpc — code-first
builder.Services.AddGrpc();            // Grpc.AspNetCore — proto-first

// Wolverine's gRPC adapter (exception interceptor, discovery, codegen pipeline)
builder.Services.AddWolverineGrpc();

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseRouting();

// Discovers every '*GrpcService' / [WolverineGrpcService] type and maps it for you.
// Proto-first stubs generate a concrete wrapper on the fly.
app.MapWolverineGrpcServices();

app.Run();
```

From here, [How gRPC Handlers Work](./handlers) walks through what `MapWolverineGrpcServices` actually
wires up and why a gRPC handler is just an ordinary Wolverine handler with a thin service shim on top.

::: tip Runnable Samples
Six end-to-end samples live under `src/Samples/`. Five are the classic trio shape (server, client,
shared messages); `OrderChainWithGrpc` is a quartet because its proof-point is a chain between two
Wolverine servers. `dotnet run` them side by side. See [Samples](./samples) for full walkthroughs
and comparisons to the official `grpc-dotnet` examples.

## Current Limitations

- **Client streaming** and **bidirectional streaming** have no out-of-the-box adapter path yet —
  there is no `IMessageBus.StreamAsync<TRequest, TResponse>` overload, and proto-first stubs with
  these method shapes fail fast at startup with a clear error rather than silently skipping. In
  code-first you can still implement bidi manually in the service by bridging each incoming item
  through `Bus.StreamAsync<TResp>(item, ct)` — see [Streaming](./streaming) for the pattern and the
  [RacerWithGrpc](https://github.com/JasperFx/wolverine/tree/main/src/Samples/RacerWithGrpc) sample.
- **Exception mapping** of the canonical `Exception → StatusCode` table is not yet user-configurable
  on the server side (follow-up item). Rich, structured responses are already available — see
  [Error Handling](./errors). On the client side, `WolverineGrpcClientOptions.MapRpcException`
  already allows per-client overrides — see [Typed gRPC Clients](./client#per-client-override).
- **`MiddlewareScoping.Grpc` middleware** — the enum value ships and is honored by Wolverine's
  discovery primitives, but no code path yet *weaves* `[WolverineBefore(MiddlewareScoping.Grpc)]`
  / `[WolverineAfter(MiddlewareScoping.Grpc)]` methods into the generated gRPC service wrappers.
  The attribute is safe to apply — it compiles, it is correctly filtered away from message-handler
  and HTTP chains, and it will start firing once the codegen path (tracked as M15) lands — but
  today nothing runs at RPC time. Until then, middleware that needs to execute on gRPC calls
  should live in a custom gRPC interceptor rather than rely on the attribute or on
  `services.AddWolverineGrpc(g => g.AddMiddleware<T>())` (both take effect together in M15).

## Roadmap

The gRPC integration has a handful of deferred items that are known-good fits but haven't shipped
yet. They're listed here so contributors can plan around them and consumers know what's coming.

- **`MiddlewareScoping.Grpc` codegen weaving (M15)** — attribute-based middleware on gRPC stubs
  (see Current Limitations above). Phase 0 landed the discovery + options surface; Phase 1 will
  wire execution into the generated `GrpcServiceChain` wrappers.
- **`Validate` convention → `Status?`** — HTTP handlers already support an opt-in `Validate` method
  whose non-null return short-circuits the call. The gRPC equivalent would return
  `Grpc.Core.Status?` (or a richer `google.rpc.Status`) so a handler could express "this call is
  invalid, return `InvalidArgument` with these field violations" without throwing. Deferred because
  it lands cleanest on top of the code-first codegen work below.
- **Code-first codegen parity** — proto-first services flow through a generated `GrpcServiceChain`
  with the usual JasperFx codegen pipeline; code-first services (the `WolverineGrpcServiceBase` path)
  currently resolve dependencies via service location inside each method. Generating per-method code
  files for code-first services — matching the HTTP and message handler story — is the prerequisite
  for the `Validate` convention above and for tighter Lamar/MSDI optimization.
- **Hybrid handler shape (HTTP + gRPC + messaging on one type)** — open design question. The
  [hybrid HTTP/message handler](/guide/http/endpoints#http-endpoint-message-handler-combo) pattern
  works today for two protocols; extending it to three raises naming and scoping questions
  (`MiddlewareScoping` only permits one value per `[Middleware]` attribute, and the handler method
  name conventions overlap). No concrete plan yet — feedback welcome on the tracking issue.
